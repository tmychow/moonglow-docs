There are two ways to use Moonglow

1. Pay for Moonglow's integrated cloud CPUs and GPUs
2. Bring your own compute e.g. use Moonglow with your AWS account

### Moonglow compute

We give you $5 free credits to start with, and you can always add more in the [Settings](https://app.moonglow.ai/settings) page.

You are charged for the amount of time you spend with the remote machine active, and the current prices are:

| Machine | $ per Hour |
| -------- | --------- |
| CPU (small) | 0.3 |
| CPU | 3 |
| A40 | 1.5 |
| A10 | 4.75 |
| H100 | 6 |

### Bring your own compute

Right now, we support integrating with your company's AWS account. [Chat with us](https://calendly.com/moonglowai/onboarding) to hear about our enterprise pricing!

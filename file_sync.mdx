Filesync is only supported by default on Mac and Linux. 

If you are using Windows, you must install [WSLinux](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl) and rsync.

### (Prerequisite) Create an SSH Key

You must have an SSH key configured on your local machine. Note that Moonglow can't currently support SSH keys with passphrases.

<Accordion title="Create an SSH Key">
    1. Open the Terminal
    2. Paste the text below, replacing the email used with your own:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    3. When you're prompted to save it, press enter:

    ```bash
    > Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):[Press enter]
    ```

    4. When you're prompted to set a passphrase, leave it empty and press enter twice.

## Syncing your local workspace to the remote machine

**Step 1**: Press "cmd + shift + P" (Mac) or "ctrl + shift + P" (Windows).

**Step 2**: Select "Moonglow: Sync Workspace to Remote"

**Step 3**: Select the notebook associated with the remote machine you want it synced to.

## Syncing your remote machine back to your local workspace

**Step 1**: Press "cmd + shift + P" (Mac) or "ctrl + shift + P" (Windows).

**Step 2**: Select "Moonglow: Sync Remote to Workspace"

**Step 3**: Select the notebook associated with the remote machine you want it synced from.

## Notes

- The first sync may take some time, but syncs after that should be substantially faster.
- We currently don't sync anything defined in your `.gitignore` to the remote machine.
- We don't sync dotfiles back from the remote machine.

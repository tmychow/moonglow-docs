<Info>Make sure you are using VSCode v1.89.0 or above.</Info>

## With VSCode

### Step 1. Go to the Extensions sidebar

### Step 2. Search for "Moonglow"

### Step 3. Press install / update

## With Cursor

Cursor doesn't update its index of extensions as frequently as VSCode, which means that sometimes the version it shows in the Extensions sidebar isn't up to date.

### Step 1. Go to the Extensions marketplace

To guarantee you're getting the latest and greatest version of Moonglow, head to the [Extensions marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moonglow.moonglowextension).

Click on "Download Extension" on the right hand side of the screen

### Step 2. Install / update using the .vsix file

Once the .vsix file has downloaded, open the Extensions sidebar in Cursor and drag the file into the sidebar.
